# Problem Statement:  
For a safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. 
# Objective:
Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using the historical data.
# Analysis to be done: 
Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.
